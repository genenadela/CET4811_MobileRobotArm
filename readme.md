**Operation Description**

The mobile arm robot follows commands as issued by a smartphone application via Bluetooth. A number of preset commands have been applied to the program to allow the user varying degrees of control regarding position of the robot, placement of the arm, and engagement of the robotâ€™s end-effector/gripper. When the robot is finished executing a single command, it will await further instructions.

**Potential Applications**

A mobile robot with multiple points of articulation may be beneficial in industries where the movement of hazardous goods or material that may harm a human worker, may be operated remotely. The robot may also see some use in aiding the physically impaired, allowing the user to acquire objects they may not be able to physically grasp on their own using a touchscreen interface for control.
